Resurrectio
===========

**Any phantom deserves a resurrection.**

Resurrectio is a Chrome extension allowing to record a sequence of browser
actions and to produce the corresponding `CasperJS  <http://casperjs.org/>`_
script.

Resurrectio uses minimalist and functional-oriented selectors, so recorded
sequences keep valid across layout and design changes.

As **CasperJS evaluates Javascript**, recorded sequences are not be limited
to pure HTML interactions, targeted pages javascript-supported behaviors will
be accurately reproduced.

Resurrectio also provides a way to produce **screenshots** alongside your test
scenario, and can export comments + screenshots in ReStructuredText format in
order to generate documentation automatically from the test sequences.

Installation
============

CasperJS / PhantomJS
--------------------

Install `PhantomJS <http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/Installation>`_,
be careful CasperJS requires PhantomJS >= 1.5.

Install `CasperJS <http://casperjs.org/installation.html>`_.

You can require a **screenshot** at any moment (they will be produced everytime
you run the resulting test).

You might also record some comments (click again on the extension icon, and
click **Add comment**).

click **Stop recording**.

Now, generate the CasperJS test script by clicking **Export Casper test**.
